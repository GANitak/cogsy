Cogsy - a command line curses-based Discogs client written in Rust

capabilities:
saves a user's discogs collection into a local database
pulls new collection updates from discogs
random song functionality
track listens and show listening history using unicode braille
track money spent on record purchases and graph history using unicode braille
aims to be as independent of the internet as possible
 - only connects to the internet to pull user data (i.e. when running update)
 - everything else is handled offline (locally)
 
app flow:
running without any arguments enters interactive mode
else, when run with a command, executes command and exits
commands can also be executed in interactive mode

 interactive mode layout:
   |
   |---main table of data (album title, artist, release year)
   |   (user can change screen by pressing number keys and exit by pressing q)
   |
   |---command line (user can enter in commands with arguments and options)
       (accessed with vim-like keybindings ":")

   list of commands:
   - update (when run without options, pulls updates from discogs collection and wantlist and updates local database)
        -t, --token (updates the auth token stored locally)
        -u, --username (updates the username stored locally)
            username is stored with the database
            (when running update, it checks if the username has changed
            if changed, it purges the current database and repopulates it with entries from the new username's collection)
   - random (selects a random album from the database for user to play and adds entry to listening log)
        -n, --nolog (does not add to listening log)
   - price [album] [price] (sets the amount paid for the album)
        (defaults to amount pulled from discogs)
   - listen [album] [time] (when run without time, logs the current time)
   - query [album] (queries the local database for album and displays release information)
        (no plans to support API queries)
   
list of screens (accessed by typing their names in the commandline)
1: collection (main)
    - clicking enter on the entry brings up its release information
2: wantlist
   - same as collection
3: profile
   - displays user profile pulled from discogs plus some additional info
      - highest rated album
      - most listened album in the past 30 days
      - most listened album of all time
      - most expensive album
      - artist with the most albums in collection
4: history (graphs the listening history of an album)
   - side menu of each album in collection, search bar at top
    (up/down to scroll, the graph of the highlighted album on the right)
5: money spent (graph built with unicode braille)
6: log (log of when albums were added)

TODO:
  - Implement live updating of release info
    (Implemented for collection)
  - Implement popup of release info
    (abstract into separate file)
  - Implement different colours for folder list
  - Switching folders in collection screen
  - Discogs API querying
  - Database API
  - Handling of various folders in collection database
    and sorting their entries into the database
    (i.e. Maintain one master table with a folders field
     or maintain multiple tables for each folder?)
  - Coloured messages (Not important)

  Two options for loading in the popup screens:
  1: Keep the screen data associated with the master app struct
  Somehow find a way to handle multiple mutable ownership,
  and have the closure edit the app struct fields

  2: Dissociate the popup structs from the app
  Instantiate the structs within the closure
  i.e. Read from db, parse data, construct screen and display
  Only instantiated when closure fires and is never loaded beforehand
